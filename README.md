# Java_Android_Blackjack
Vanilla Java + Android Blackjack Card Game App

BRIEF:
  Card game

  Goal: Create a card game in Android.

  We recommend something reasonably straight forward like BlackJack. The logic for your app will be in Java classes and you can use the methods in these classes in Android activites to create a UI.

  HINT Think of the lessons where we wrote regular Java classes in Android Studio, ran unit tests on them, and then used them in our Eight Ball app.

  MVP
    The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic. For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:
    Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
    Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts
    Player 1 Wins!
 
 Project Extensions
    Possibly add another card game
    Improve the UI

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT I'D LIKE TO CHANGE/ADD:

  Make it more SOLID to ensure that further implementation of different card games can reuse the same code.
  
  UI/UX improvements.  Display the 3rd, 4th & 5th cards as cards rather than text.
  
  Add another game - Jacks,Twos & 8s/Irish Switch may have to wait due to AI logic, but Texas Hold'em logic should be doable
